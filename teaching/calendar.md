2017-11-06 Mon | RP.1        | 1            |     |     |     |     | Block 1: NC Check-Ins, [StephanRP1] **Inquiry Lab** to explore unit rate concept: Students find unit rates in groups of 3, one hopper, one timekeeper, one counter. Students record hop data and write as a rate, then convert into a unit rate. Answer questions about who hopped the most times, how to compare results for different people. Is it fair to compare the number of hops? Who hopped the fastest? Students will look at the results and talk through the results without help. When tables are wrapping up discussion, we discuss as an entire class. **Table Discussion:** What is the purpose of a unit rate? How are unit rates useful in making comparisons? 
2017-11-07 Tue | RP.1        | 2            |     |     |     |     | [StephanRP2] **Part 1: What are complex fractions?** Way of showing division of two fractions. Walk through simple complex fractions with students. One or two together using think aloud: How do we write this as division of fractions? Who remembers how to divide fractions? Go over a word problem. Want rate in miles per hour, so put miles on top and hours on bottom. How do we divide when we have a mixed number?(Need to change to improper fraction) Students practice with simple examples. **Part 2: Table Practice.** Coming off some straightforward examples, I want to give students an opportunity to now grapple with the mathematics – and take these complex fractions to the next level. In these table examples, students are not only asked to find unit rates using complex fractions, but also compare these rates. For fun, I often ask my students to take a guess at which one they think is going to be the “winner” based on what is in the problem, and then I have them work it out and get an answer. The beauty of this is that often times they are wrong, so they see that guessing isn’t such a good idea. These examples model the use of complex fractions in the real world, which is mathematical practice 4, and require students to reason abstractly and quantitatively, mathematical practice 2. Additionally, students will need to persevere with problem solving, as I am going to be hands off! (mathematical practice 1). **Table Discussion**, **Homework**
2017-11-08 Wed | RP.1        | 3            |     |     |     |     | [StephanRP3] **Relay Race:** To work on fluency with unit rates, students will work with their homogeneous table groups to complete the unit rates relay race.  During the activity, I will monitor progress and sit and work with students/groups that appear to be struggling with the concept. The questions within this activity bring in several of the practices, including mathematical practice 7 – looking for and making use of structure, mathematical practice 1 – persevering with problem solving, mathematical practice 2 – reason abstractly, and mathematical practice 4 – modeling with mathematics. **Summary:** Complete exit ticket. Complete one word problem on the back of the opener. See who is getting it and who is not to determine who to pull aside for additional help.
2017-11-09 Thu | RP.1        | 4            |     |     |     |     | [StephanRP4] **Self Checking Color Sheet** Students will work to complete 20 unit rate problems without a calculator.  I like for students to get immediate feedback on their efforts, and since there is only 1 of me, a self-checking activity like a color by answer is a good method of providing that immediate feedback.  Thus, students will complete a problem and look for their answer on the scarecrow, and should they choose to color (I don't force them to color, but most like the short break after a problem) they color the corresponding section of the picture whatever color the number says (for example, if question 1 is red, and the answer is 54 - anywhere they see a 54 on the picture they color it red).  While students are working on the assignment, I am freed up to assist as necessary, as I am not bogged down by "is this right?" "can you look at this?"  When completing the problems, students are urged to keep trying until they can arrive at an answer on the picture (mathematical practice 1).  Working with complex fractions and units requires students to be very careful with operations and units (mathematical practice 6).  As students become more comfortable with the problems, they are able to develop shortcuts for making the problems easier (mathematical practice 8) - for example, looking for the term "per" to help them determine the numerator and denominator of the rate. **Summary:** Table discussion: What is unit rate? Complex fractions, jumped into word problems. Make sure they understand what unit rate means. How would you define it? Have tables share their definitions. Provide positive reinforcement through learner profile tickets. Ensure that when they see a question asking about unit rate that they have an understanding of what they are looking for.

2017-11-13 Mon | RP.2        | 5            |     |     |     |     | [StephanRP5] **Discovery Activity** Students discover proportional relationships without teacher input, so that they can. Activity walks through determining how far a tortoise travels in one second. Look at bar diagram, complete table, calculate ratios. Asked what do you notice about ratios and how does tortoise travel in relation to time? They will determine that tortoise travels 3.5 inches per second, a constant speed (a constand distance per second). Two reflection questions: Suppose a tortoise travels for 12 seconds. How far do you think he can go? Do you think he travels at a constant speed? This does everything that the lesson does but in an informal manner. Lesson is easy, students probably already know how to do it, but may not know the name for the concepts? **Notes on proportional and nonprp** Proportional relationship: relationship between quantities where the ratio of one to the other is constant. Question: Do you think the tortoise was proportional? Yes, he traveled at a constant speed (always 3.5 inches per second). Think aloud: Alberto types 45 wpm. Is this proportional or not? Students make table, calculate ration of words per time. Ratios are ... The common ratio is ... The relationship is (proportional/nonproportional). Think aloud: Table already filled out. Ask to determine whether proportional or not. What do you think we should do? Set up ratios. Proportional or nonproportional? Do you think she traveled at a constant speed? Example with fixed cost and hourly cost for a boat ride. Have students discuss. Chime in if they are struggling. Allow student to struggle with the math. Students need to dig in and figure out what is going on. End examples with a note: When you calculate ratios between quantities in tables, you are actually calculating what? Unit rate. This connection will help when setting up and using equations and graphs. **Summary:** To summarize this lesson, I will have students have a table discussion on the question:  To determine if a relationship was proportional or not, we looked for a constant ratio.  What do you think the technical term for this constant ratio is?  In the next lesson, we will move towards identifying the constant of proportionality, k, and writing equations.  This summary activity is a lead in to that. I am almost confident that no groups will come up with “constant of proportionality,” but it is fun to see! I am not going to tell them if no one gets it, they will have to stay tuned tomorrow!
2017-11-14 Tue | RP.2        | 2            |     |     |     |     | [StephanRP6]  This lesson requires that students look for repeated reasoning, which will help them to determine if a relationship is proportional or not (mathematical practice 8). Students will be required to develop models for real world problems (mathematical practice 4) as well as reason through problems (mathematical practice 2). **Notes:** Yesterday we ended with hanger of what the constant ratio is called. Notes: To express a proportional relationship using an equation, the first thing we need to find is the constant ratio, called the constant of proportionality. To remember this, recall that we have to have a constant ratio to have a proportional relationship. If given a table, the constant ratio is always found by taking the ratio y/x (not x/y). If given a word problem, how do they determine what the y and the x are? Look at what the question is asking. You want the answer to the question to be your y. If you are looking for a number of miles, you want y to be your miles and x to be your hours. This makes working the problem out a little easier. Since we have not gotten to equations, we want to write these in a way that will be easy to solve. For writing equations, we look at some table. Calculate the constant of proportionality for each table (same thing that we did yesterday). Take suggestions about how this will go into an equation. See if someone can get that we just put that constant ratio into the equation. Go through cashews problem about cost per pound. Two additional problems that students work on in tables: Amounts of flower v. servings, Saving money v. weeks. Call on tables to come up and present to the class. **Summary:** To summarize this lesson, I will have students have a table discussion on the question:  How is writing an equation helpful for solving problems?  I want to hear students discussing how writing the equation makes it easier because you can just multiply to find answers to large problems, instead of having to continue a pattern in a table. **Homework**
