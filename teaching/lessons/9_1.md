Adapted from: [Stephan17]

## Review / Warm-up (10 min)

 * Sign on front table says to take a warm-up and homework from the table
 * [Warm-up](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1WN7I2qxY9EZmdnV2dYamtuc3c)
 * Slides on board indicate homework for the night

## Objectives / Essential Questions 

 * I can add and subtract rational numbers
 * How do the rules for adding and subtracting integers apply to adding and subtracting rational numbers?

## Transition to lesson

## Lesson Input / Modeling (3 minutes)

 * Review definition of rational numbers and diagram (3 minutes)

## Class Activity

### Independent Practice (30 minutes)
#### Relay Race 
 * [Relay race questions](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwSVe4aULWrTcDBTeHA0WlVldjg)
 * Students who get 3-4 questions correct on the warm-up start on problem 13.
 * Tell these students that they need to persevere in solving the problems. If they do not get the answer that I have provided in my answer key, then they need to work to try to recognize any mistakes and correct them.
 * Other students start on problems 1-12.
 * I will work with students who are working on problems 1-12, helping them resolve any issues that I noticed when they did their warm-ups, e.g.:
     - rules for adding and subtracting
     - common denominator
     - lining up decimal points

### Ongoing Assessment (5 minutes)
 * Exit ticket with one problem?

### Summary/Closure (5 minutes)
 * Present a multiplication and a division problem with signed fractions
 * Students discuss how they think we multiply and divide signed fractions
