## Objective: I can add and subtract signed fractions
Adapted from: [Stephan15]

## Review / Warm-up (10 min)

 * Sign on front table says to take a warm-up and homework from the table
 * Slides on board indicate homework for the night
 * **Collect warm-ups from 5th block**

## Objectives / Essential Questions 

 * I can add and subtract signed fractions
 * How do the rules for adding and subtracting integers apply to adding and subtracting signed fractions?
 * How do we add and subtract positive fractions if the denominators of the fractions are different?
 * How does the distributive law help us think about adding and subtracting signed fractions?

## Transition to lesson (10 minutes)
 * Before the lesson, we review the homework assignment from the previous night.

## Lesson Input / Modeling (8 minutes)

 * Teacher reviews slides with:
     - definition of rational numbers and diagram (guided notes) (1 minutes)
     - 4 steps for adding and subtracting rational numbers (2 minutes)
     - present one example (4 minutes)

## Class Activity

### Guided Practice 
#### Grouping Quiz (20 minutes)
 * Pass out grouping quiz and have students complete it (14 minutes)
 * Show answers to the grouping quiz on the screen
 * Students pair up and exchange their grouping quiz papers (1 minutes)
 * Students mark the questions that are correct or incorrect (2 minutes)
 * Students write their score out of 5 at the top of the quiz 
 * Collect grouping quiz (2 minutes)

#### Small Group Practice (20 minutes/0 minutes)
 * I work with students to identify their difficulties with the grouping quiz (If the number is small, we can move, but if it is most of the class, we will ask the students who are working independently to try to tune us out)
 * we drill on:
     - converting mixed numbers to improper fractions
     - finding common denominators
     - adding and subtracting integers
     - putting these steps together to add and subtract signed integers

#### Independent Practice (10 minutes/30 minutes)
 * Students who got 4/5 or more correct on the quiz work independently on the versatiles worksheet instead of participating in small group practice.

### Ongoing Assessment (5 minutes)
 * Exit ticket with one problem?

### Summary/Closure (2 minutes)
 * Review the steps for adding and subtracting signed fractions
