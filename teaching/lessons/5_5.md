## Objective: I can add and subtract signed fractions
Adapted from: [Stephan14]

## Review / Warm-up (10 min)

 * Sign on front table says to take a warm-up and homework from the table
 * Slides on board indicate homework for the week, and instructs students to record HW in their agendas
 * I check that they have recorded their HW

## Objectives / Essential Questions 

 * I can add and subtract signed fractions
 * How do the rules for adding and subtracting integers apply to adding and subtracting signed fractions?
 * How do we add and subtract positive fractions if the denominators of the fractions are different?
 * How does the distributive law help us think about adding and subtracting signed fractions?

## Lesson Input / Modeling (15 minutes)

 * Teacher presents slides, student copy the following in notebooks
     - objective (1 minute)
     - definition of rational numbers and diagram (guided notes) (3 minutes)
     - 4 steps for adding and subtracting rational numbers (4 minutes)
     - my solutions to examples 1 and 2, which I will write on the board (6 minutes)

## Class Activity

### Guided Practice (20 minutes)
 * We talk through examples 3 and 4 together, I call on students to explain each step, write the solutions on the board. All students copy examples 3 and 4 (8 minutes)
 * Set timer for 4 minutes
 * Students do example 5 with partner, I circulate and find a student who presents the solution to the class
 * Repeat for example 6, students do example 7 independently 

### Independent Practice (30 minutes)
 * Table challenge: students work in groups to solve problems on the board
     - Procedure: Show instructions slide, explain steps
         - Assign groups, give each group a piece of paper, have them write their group number on the paper
         - I will put a problem on the screen and set the timer
         - One person from each group will solve the problem on the paper, choose one person to go first
         - When time is up, I will roll the die and the person in that group who solved the problem will present the solution at the board.
         - The class will critique the reasoning and the person who presents will make corrections
         - When the class agrees that the solution is correct, we move onto the next problem.

### Ongoing Assessment (5 minutes)
 * Exit ticket with one problem

### Summary/Closure (2 minutes)
 * Review the steps for adding and subtracting signed fractions
