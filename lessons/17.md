## Summary

This lesson requires that students look for repeated reasoning, which will help them to determine if a relationship is proportional or not (mathematical practice 8). Students will be required to develop models for real world problems (mathematical practice 4) as well as reason through problems (mathematical practice 2). **Notes:** Yesterday we ended with hanger of what the constant ratio is called. Notes: To express a proportional relationship using an equation, the first thing we need to find is the constant ratio, called the constant of proportionality. To remember this, recall that we have to have a constant ratio to have a proportional relationship. If given a table, the constant ratio is always found by taking the ratio y/x (not x/y). If given a word problem, how do they determine what the y and the x are? Look at what the question is asking. You want the answer to the question to be your y. If you are looking for a number of miles, you want y to be your miles and x to be your hours. This makes working the problem out a little easier. Since we have not gotten to equations, we want to write these in a way that will be easy to solve. For writing equations, we look at some table. Calculate the constant of proportionality for each table (same thing that we did yesterday). Take suggestions about how this will go into an equation. See if someone can get that we just put that constant ratio into the equation. Go through cashews problem about cost per pound. Two additional problems that students work on in tables: Amounts of flower v. servings, Saving money v. weeks. Call on tables to come up and present to the class. **Summary:** To summarize this lesson, I will have students have a table discussion on the question:  How is writing an equation helpful for solving problems?  I want to hear students discussing how writing the equation makes it easier because you can just multiply to find answers to large problems, instead of having to continue a pattern in a table. **Homework**
