Through the openers, I have tried to spiral the concept of unit rate throughout the entire course, thus applying it in this lesson does not come as a major road bump for students.\u0026nbsp; The largest issue I have seen students have with this concept is the mixing of the units - they do not want to make a rate out of 1 inch equal to 50 miles - because in reality one inch is not equal to 50 miles.\u0026nbsp; However, I try to remind students that they are working in the context of a problem, they are not working with real conversions.\u0026nbsp; Having maps and other scale drawings available for kids to reference is very helpful!\u0026nbsp; This lesson is also a good use of mathematical practices 3, 4, and 5 - as students are working together and giving one another feedback on their work (3), and this lesson lends itself to modeling real world situations (4).\u0026nbsp;

on a question that requires students to take it a step further and find the dimensions of a figure, not just the measurement of one side.\u0026nbsp; Though this concept is not any harder, for some reason the term \u0026ldquo;dimensions\u0026rdquo; throws kids off.\u0026nbsp; Thus, this summary activity will allow students the opportunity to see and work with the term in a group setting. \u0026nbsp;Teacher observations during this discussion allow me to hear who is getting it and who is not. \u0026nbsp;Though this is a more challenging problem, students who have a good grasp on the concept will be able offer sound reasoning to their table regarding how to start this problem.\u003c/p\u003e", "num": 0, "share": 3, "user_id": 76246}, "narrative_id": 1273, "narrative_type": 28,

<p>White Board Practice: The use of white boards in small groups allows me to see which tables are struggling, and position myself to give them immediate feedback and help.&nbsp; I like to correct problems as they are happening as opposed to finding out there is an issue after they have left my class.&nbsp; Forcing the kids to rotate the board gives every child an opportunity to write and solve problems, and gives me, the teacher, the opportunity to see if they get it!</p>
